worthy of all honour, that the name of Elohim and his doctrine be not
blasphemed.

6:2 And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them,
because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are
faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and
exhort.

6:3 If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even
the words of our master Yahushua Christ, and to the doctrine which is
according to righteousness;

6:4 He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes
of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,

6:5 Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the
truth, supposing that gain is righteousness: from such withdraw thyself.

6:6 But righteousness with contentment is great gain.

6:7 For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can
carry nothing out.

6:8 And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.

6:9 But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and
into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and
perdition.

6:10 For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some
coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves
through with many sorrows.

6:11 But thou, O man of Elohim, flee these things; and follow after
righteousness, righteousness, faith, love, patience, meekness.

6:12 Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto
thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many
witnesses.

6:13 I give thee charge in the sight of Elohim, who quickeneth all things,
and before Christ Yahushua, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good
confession;

6:14 That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukable, until
the appearing of our master Yahushua Christ:

6:15 Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only
Potentate, the King of kings, and Master of Masters;

6:16 Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can
approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and
power everlasting. Amen.

6:17 Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not
highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living Elohim, who
giveth us richly all things to enjoy;

6:18 That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to
distribute, willing to communicate;

6:19 Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the
time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.

6:20 O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding
profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so
called:

6:21 Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be
with thee. Amen.",
