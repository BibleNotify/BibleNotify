house of Israel.

5:2 The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is
forsaken upon her land; there is none to raise her up.

5:3 For thus saith Yahweh Elohim; The city that went out by a thousand
shall leave an hundred, and that which went forth by an hundred shall
leave ten, to the house of Israel.

5:4 For thus saith Yahweh unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye
shall live:

5:5 But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to
Beersheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall
come to nought.

5:6 Seek Yahweh, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the
house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to quench it in
Bethel.

5:7 Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the
earth,

5:8 Seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the
shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night:
that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the
face of the earth: Yahweh is his name:

5:9 That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the
spoiled shall come against the fortress.

5:10 They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that
speaketh uprightly.

5:11 Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor, and ye take
from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye
shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye
shall not drink wine of them.

5:12 For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they
afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the
gate from their right.

5:13 Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it is an
evil time.

5:14 Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so Yahweh, the Elohim
of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken.

5:15 Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the
gate: it may be that Yahweh Elohim of hosts will be gracious unto the
remnant of Joseph.

5:16 Therefore Yahweh, the Elohim of hosts, Yahweh, saith thus; Wailing
shall be in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas!
alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are
skilful of lamentation to wailing.

5:17 And in all vineyards shall be wailing: for I will pass through
thee, saith Yahweh.

5:18 Woe unto you that desire the day of Yahweh! to what end is it for
you? the day of Yahweh is darkness, and not light.

5:19 As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into
the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.

5:20 Shall not the day of Yahweh be darkness, and not light? even very
dark, and no brightness in it?

5:21 I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your
solemn assemblies.

5:22 Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will
not accept them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat
beasts.

5:23 Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear
the melody of thy viols.

5:24 But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty
stream.

5:25 Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness
forty years, O house of Israel?

5:26 But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your
images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.

5:27 Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus,
saith Yahweh, whose name is The Elohim of hosts.",
