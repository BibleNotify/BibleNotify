31:2 And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this
day; I can no more go out and come in: also Yahweh hath said unto me,
Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.

31:3 Yahweh thy Elohim he will go over before thee, and he will destroy
these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess them: and Joshua,
he shall go over before thee, as Yahweh hath said.

31:4 And Yahweh shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings
of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he destroyed.

31:5 And Yahweh shall give them up before your face, that ye may do
unto them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded
you.

31:6 Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them:
for Yahweh thy Elohim, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail
thee, nor forsake thee.

31:7 And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all
Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must go with this
people unto the land which Yahweh hath sworn unto their fathers to
give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.

31:8 And Yahweh he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with
thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be
dismayed.

31:9 And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the
sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of Yahweh and unto
all the elders of Israel.

31:10 And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years,
in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,

31:11 When all Israel is come to appear before Yahweh thy Elohim in the
place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel
in their hearing.

31:12 Gather the people together, men and women, and children, and thy
stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may
learn, and fear Yahweh your Elohim, and observe to do all the words of
this law:

31:13 And that their children, which have not known any thing, may hear,
and learn to fear Yahweh your Elohim as long as ye live in the land
whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.

31:14 And Yahweh said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou
must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the
congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went,
and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation.

31:15 And Yahweh appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud:
and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle.

31:16 And Yahweh said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy
fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods
of the strangers of the land, whither they go to be among them, and will
forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.

31:17 Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I
will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be
devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that they
will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because our Elohim
is not among us?

31:18 And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which
they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other Mighty ones.

31:19 Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the
children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a
witness for me against the children of Israel.

31:20 For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware
unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall
have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn
unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.

31:21 And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are
befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness;
for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I
know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have
brought them into the land which I sware.

31:22 Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the
children of Israel.

31:23 And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong
and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into
the land which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee.

31:24 And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the
words of this law in a book, until they were finished,

31:25 That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the
covenant of Yahweh, saying,

31:26 Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of
the covenant of Yahweh your Elohim that it may be there for a witness
against thee.

31:27 For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am
yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against Yahweh 
and how much more after my death?

31:28 Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers,
that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to
record against them.

31:29 For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves,
and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will
befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the sight of Yahweh
 to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.

31:30 And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the
words of this song, until they were ended.",
