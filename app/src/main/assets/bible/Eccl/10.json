stinking savour: so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for
wisdom and honour.

10:2 A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his
left.

10:3 Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom
faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool.

10:4 If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy
place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.

10:5 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error which
proceedeth from the ruler:

10:6 Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.

10:7 I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants
upon the earth.

10:8 He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an
hedge, a serpent shall bite him.

10:9 Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth
wood shall be endangered thereby.

10:10 If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he
put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.

10:11 Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is
no better.

10:12 The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a
fool will swallow up himself.

10:13 The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the
end of his talk is mischievous madness.

10:14 A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and
what shall be after him, who can tell him?

10:15 The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he
knoweth not how to go to the city.

10:16 Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat
in the morning!

10:17 Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and
thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!

10:18 By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness
of the hands the house droppeth through.

10:19 A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money
answereth all things.

10:20 Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich
in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that
which hath wings shall tell the matter.",
