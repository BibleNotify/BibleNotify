days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no
pleasure in them;

12:2 While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not
darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain:

12:3 In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the
strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are
few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened,

12:4 And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the
grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all
the daughters of musick shall be brought low;

12:5 Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears
shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the
grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goeth
to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets:

12:6 Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or
the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the
cistern.

12:7 Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit
shall return unto Elohim who gave it.

12:8 Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity.

12:9 And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the
people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, and set in
order many proverbs.

12:10 The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and that which
was written was upright, even words of truth.

12:11 The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the
masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.

12:12 And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books
there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.

12:13 Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear Elohim, and keep
his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.

12:14 For Elohim shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret
thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.",
