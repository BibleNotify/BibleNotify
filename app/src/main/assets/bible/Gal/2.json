Elohim forbid.</p><p><sup>18</sup> For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.</p><p><sup>19</sup> For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto Elohim.</p><p><sup>20</sup> I am crucified with Messiah: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Messiah liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of Elohim, who loved me, and gave himself for me.</p><p><sup>21</sup> I do not frustrate the grace of Elohim: for if righteousness come by the law, then Messiah is dead in vain.</p>",       "chapter": "Galatians 2"     }  ] }
