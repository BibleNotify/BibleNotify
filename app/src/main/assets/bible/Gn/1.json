1:2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the
face of the deep. And the Spirit of Elohim moved upon the face of the
waters.

1:3 And Elohim said, Let there be light: and there was light.

1:4 And Elohim saw the light, that it was good: and Elohim divided the light
from the darkness.

1:5 And Elohim called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And
the evening and the morning were the first day.

1:6 And Elohim said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters,
and let it divide the waters from the waters.

1:7 And Elohim made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under
the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was
so.

1:8 And Elohim called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning
were the second day.

1:9 And Elohim said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together
unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.

1:10 And Elohim called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of
the waters called he Seas: and Elohim saw that it was good.

1:11 And Elohim said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding
seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in
itself, upon the earth: and it was so.

1:12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his
kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his
kind: and Elohim saw that it was good.

1:13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.

1:14 And Elohim said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to
divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for
seasons, and for days, and years:

1:15 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give
light upon the earth: and it was so.

1:16 And Elohim made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day,
and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.

1:17 And Elohim set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon
the earth,

1:18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the
light from the darkness: and Elohim saw that it was good.

1:19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.

1:20 And Elohim said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving
creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the
open firmament of heaven.

1:21 And Elohim created great whales, and every living creature that
moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and
every winged fowl after his kind: and Elohim saw that it was good.

1:22 And Elohim blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill
the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.

1:23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.

1:24 And Elohim said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after
his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his
kind: and it was so.

1:25 And Elohim made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle
after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his
kind: and Elohim saw that it was good.

1:26 And Elohim said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and
let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of
the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every
creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.

1:27 So Elohim created man in his own image, in the image of Elohim created he
him; male and female created he them.

1:28 And Elohim blessed them, and Elohim said unto them, Be fruitful, and
multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over
the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living
thing that moveth upon the earth.

1:29 And Elohim said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed,
which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is
the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.

1:30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and
to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I
have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.

1:31 And Elohim saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very
good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.",
