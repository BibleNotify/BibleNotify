them.

2:2 And on the seventh day Elohim ended his work which he had made; and he
rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.

2:3 And Elohim blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in
it he had rested from all his work which Elohim created and made.

2:4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they
were created, in the day that the Yahweh Elohim made the earth and the
heavens,

2:5 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every
herb of the field before it grew: for the Yahweh Elohim had not caused it to
rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.

2:6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face
of the ground.

2:7 And the Yahweh Elohim formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed
into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.

2:8 And the Yahweh Elohim planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put
the man whom he had formed.

2:9 And out of the ground made the Yahweh Elohim to grow every tree that is
pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the
midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

2:10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence
it was parted, and became into four heads.

2:11 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the
whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;

2:12 And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx
stone.

2:13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that
compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.

2:14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth
toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.

2:15 And the Yahweh Elohim took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden
to dress it and to keep it.

2:16 And the Yahweh Elohim commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the
garden thou mayest freely eat:

2:17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not
eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely
die.

2:18 And the Yahweh Elohim said, It is not good that the man should be alone;
I will make him an help meet for him.

2:19 And out of the ground the Yahweh Elohim formed every beast of the field,
and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he
would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that
was the name thereof.

2:20 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and
to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help
meet for him.

2:21 And the Yahweh Elohim caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he
slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead
thereof;

2:22 And the rib, which the Yahweh Elohim had taken from man, made he a
woman, and brought her unto the man.

2:23 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh:
she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.

2:24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall
cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.

2:25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not
ashamed.",
