And the fourth river is Euphrates.</p><p><sup>15</sup> And the Yahweh Elohim took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.</p><p><sup>16</sup> And the Yahweh Elohim commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:</p><p><sup>17</sup> But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</p><p><sup>18</sup> And the Yahweh Elohim said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.</p><p><sup>19</sup> And out of the ground the Yahweh Elohim formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.</p><p><sup>20</sup> And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.</p><p><sup>21</sup> And the Yahweh Elohim caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;</p><p><sup>22</sup> And the rib, which the Yahweh Elohim had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.</p><p><sup>23</sup> And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.</p><p><sup>24</sup> Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.</p><p><sup>25</sup> And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</p>",       "chapter": "Genesis 2"     }  ] }
