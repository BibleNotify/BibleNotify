formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called
thee by thy name; thou art mine.

43:2 When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and
through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest
through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame
kindle upon thee.

43:3 For I am Yahweh thy Elohim, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I
gave Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.

43:4 Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable,
and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and people
for thy life.

43:5 Fear not: for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east,
and gather thee from the west;

43:6 I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back:
bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth;

43:7 Even every one that is called by my name: for I have created him
for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.

43:8 Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have
ears.

43:9 Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be
assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things?
let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let
them hear, and say, It is truth.

43:10 Ye are my witnesses, saith Yahweh, and my servant whom I have
chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he:
before me there was no Elohim formed, neither shall there be after me.

43:11 I, even I, am Yahweh; and beside me there is no saviour.

43:12 I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there was
no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith Yahweh,
that I am Yahweh.

43:13 Yea, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can
deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?

43:14 Thus saith Yahweh, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; For
your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all their
nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the ships.

43:15 I am Yahweh, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your King.

43:16 Thus saith Yahweh, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path in
the mighty waters;

43:17 Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the
power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they are
extinct, they are quenched as tow.

43:18 Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of
old.

43:19 Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye
not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the
desert.

43:20 The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls:
because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to
give drink to my people, my chosen.

43:21 This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my
praise.

43:22 But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been
weary of me, O Israel.

43:23 Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings;
neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused
thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incense.

43:24 Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou
filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me to serve
with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.

43:25 I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own
sake, and will not remember thy sins.

43:26 Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that
thou mayest be justified.

43:27 Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed
against me.

43:28 Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have
given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.",
