hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk
without money and without price.

55:2 Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your
labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and
eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.

55:3 Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall live;
and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies
of David.

55:4 Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and
commander to the people.

55:5 Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, and nations
that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of Yahweh thy Elohim, and
for the Holy One of Israel; for he hath glorified thee.

55:6 Seek ye Yahweh while he may be found, call ye upon him while he
is near:

55:7 Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his
thoughts: and let him return unto Yahweh, and he will have mercy upon
him; and to our Elohim, for he will abundantly pardon.

55:8 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my
ways, saith Yahweh.

55:9 For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher
than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.

55:10 For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and
returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth
and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater:

55:11 So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not
return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it
shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.

55:12 For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the
mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and
all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.

55:13 Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of
the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to Yahweh for
a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.",
