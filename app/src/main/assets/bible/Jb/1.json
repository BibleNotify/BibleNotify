      "text": "1:1 There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man
was perfect and upright, and one that feared Elohim and eschewed evil.

1:2 And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.

1:3 His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand
camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a
very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men
of the east.

1:4 And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day;
and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with
them.

1:5 And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that
Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and
offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job
said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed Elohim in their
hearts. Thus did Job continually.

1:6 Now there was a day when the sons of Elohim came to present themselves
before Yahweh,  and Satan came also among them.

1:7 And Yahweh said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan
answered Yahweh, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and
from walking up and down in it.

1:8 And Yahweh said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job,
that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man,
one that feareth Elohim, and escheweth evil?

1:9 Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, Doth Job fear Elohim for
nought?

1:10 Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and
about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his
hands, and his substance is increased in the land.

1:11 But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he
will curse thee to thy face.

1:12 And Yahweh said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy
power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth
from the presence of Yahweh.

1:13 And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and
drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:

1:14 And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were
plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:

1:15 And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have
slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped
alone to tell thee.

1:16 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The
fire of Elohim is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the
servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.

1:17 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The
Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have
carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the
sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.

1:18 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy
sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest
brother's house:

1:19 And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote
the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they
are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.

1:20 Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell
down upon the ground, and worshipped,

1:21 And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I
return thither: Yahweh gave, and Yahweh hath taken away; blessed be
the name of Yahweh.",
