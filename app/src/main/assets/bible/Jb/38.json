      "text": "38:1 Then Yahweh answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,

38:2 Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?

38:3 Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and
answer thou me.

38:4 Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare,
if thou hast understanding.

38:5 Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath
stretched the line upon it?

38:6 Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the
corner stone thereof;

38:7 When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of Elohim
shouted for joy?

38:8 Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it
had issued out of the womb?

38:9 When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a
swaddlingband for it,

38:10 And brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors,

38:11 And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall
thy proud waves be stayed?

38:12 Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the
dayspring to know his place;

38:13 That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked
might be shaken out of it?

38:14 It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment.

38:15 And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm
shall be broken.

38:16 Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked
in the search of the depth?

38:17 Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen
the doors of the shadow of death?

38:18 Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou
knowest it all.

38:19 Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness, where
is the place thereof,

38:20 That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou
shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?

38:21 Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born? or because the
number of thy days is great?

38:22 Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou
seen the treasures of the hail,

38:23 Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day
of battle and war?

38:24 By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the east wind
upon the earth?

38:25 Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a
way for the lightning of thunder;

38:26 To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the
wilderness, wherein there is no man;

38:27 To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud of
the tender herb to spring forth?

38:28 Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?

38:29 Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who
hath gendered it?

38:30 The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep is
frozen.

38:31 Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the
bands of Orion?

38:32 Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou
guide Arcturus with his sons?

38:33 Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion
thereof in the earth?

38:34 Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of
waters may cover thee?

38:35 Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go and say unto thee,
Here we are?

38:36 Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given
understanding to the heart?

38:37 Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles
of heaven,

38:38 When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast
together?

38:39 Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the
young lions,

38:40 When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in
wait?

38:41 Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto
Elohim, they wander for lack of meat.",
