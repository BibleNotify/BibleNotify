And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it.</p><p><sup>4</sup> Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.</p><p><sup>5</sup> And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.</p><p><sup>6</sup> When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.</p><p><sup>7</sup> And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.</p><p><sup>8</sup> And when Herod saw yahushua, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.</p><p><sup>9</sup> Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.</p><p><sup>10</sup> And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.</p><p><sup>11</sup> And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.</p><p><sup>12</sup> And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.</p><p><sup>13</sup> And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</p><p><sup>14</sup> Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:</p><p><sup>15</sup> No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.</p><p><sup>16</sup> I will therefore chastise him, and release him.</p><p><sup>17</sup> (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)</p><p><sup>18</sup> And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:</p><p><sup>19</sup> (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)</p><p><sup>20</sup> Pilate therefore, willing to release yahushua, spake again to them.</p><p><sup>21</sup> But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.</p><p><sup>22</sup> And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.</p><p><sup>23</sup> And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.</p><p><sup>24</sup> And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.</p><p><sup>25</sup> And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered yahushua to their will.</p><p><sup>26</sup> And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after yahushua.</p><p><sup>27</sup> And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.</p><p><sup>28</sup> But yahushua turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</p><p><sup>29</sup> For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.</p><p><sup>30</sup> Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.</p><p><sup>31</sup> For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</p><p><sup>32</sup> And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.</p><p><sup>33</sup> And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.</p><p><sup>34</sup> Then said yahushua, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.</p><p><sup>35</sup> And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Messiah, the chosen of Elohim.</p><p><sup>36</sup> And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,</p><p><sup>37</sup> And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.</p><p><sup>38</sup> And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p><p><sup>39</sup> And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Messiah, save thyself and us.</p><p><sup>40</sup> But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear Elohim, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?</p><p><sup>41</sup> And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.</p><p><sup>42</sup> And he said unto yahushua, master, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.</p><p><sup>43</sup> And yahushua said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</p><p><sup>44</sup> And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.</p><p><sup>45</sup> And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.</p><p><sup>46</sup> And when yahushua had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.</p><p><sup>47</sup> Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified Elohim, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.</p><p><sup>48</sup> And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.</p><p><sup>49</sup> And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.</p><p><sup>50</sup> And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he was a good man, and a just:</p><p><sup>51</sup> (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of Elohim.</p><p><sup>52</sup> This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of yahushua.</p><p><sup>53</sup> And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.</p><p><sup>54</sup> And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.</p><p><sup>55</sup> And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.</p><p><sup>56</sup> And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.</p>",       "chapter": "Luke 23"     }  ] }
