A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.</p><p><sup>15</sup> Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.</p><p><sup>16</sup> Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.</p><p><sup>17</sup> Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.</p><p><sup>18</sup> For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.</p><p><sup>19</sup> Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</p><p><sup>20</sup> For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.</p><p><sup>21</sup> Ye have heard that it was said of them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:</p><p><sup>22</sup> But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.</p><p><sup>23</sup> Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;</p><p><sup>24</sup> Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</p><p><sup>25</sup> Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.</p><p><sup>26</sup> Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.</p><p><sup>27</sup> Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:</p><p><sup>28</sup> But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.</p><p><sup>29</sup> And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.</p><p><sup>30</sup> And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.</p><p><sup>31</sup> It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:</p><p><sup>32</sup> But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.</p><p><sup>33</sup> Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto Yahweh thine oaths:</p><p><sup>34</sup> But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is Elohim's throne:</p><p><sup>35</sup> Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.</p><p><sup>36</sup> Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.</p><p><sup>37</sup> But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.</p><p><sup>38</sup> Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:</p><p><sup>39</sup> But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.</p><p><sup>40</sup> And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.</p><p><sup>41</sup> And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.</p><p><sup>42</sup> Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.</p><p><sup>43</sup> Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.</p><p><sup>44</sup> But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;</p><p><sup>45</sup> That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.</p><p><sup>46</sup> For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?</p><p><sup>47</sup> And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?</p><p><sup>48</sup> Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.</p>",       "chapter": "Matthew 5"     }  ] }
