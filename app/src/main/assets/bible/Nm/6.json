      "text": "6:1 And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying,

6:2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When either
man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a Nazarite, to
separate themselves unto Yahweh: 

6:3 He shall separate himself from wine and strong drink, and shall
drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he
drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist grapes, or dried.

6:4 All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of
the vine tree, from the kernels even to the husk.

6:5 All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come
upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which he separateth
himself unto Yahweh he shall be holy, and shall let the locks of the
hair of his head grow.

6:6 All the days that he separateth himself unto Yahweh he shall come
at no dead body.

6:7 He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother,
for his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because the
consecration of his Elohim is upon his head.

6:8 All the days of his separation he is holy unto Yahweh. 

6:9 And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled the
head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day of his
cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.

6:10 And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young
pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation:

6:11 And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the
other for a burnt offering, and make an atonement for him, for that he
sinned by the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day.

6:12 And he shall consecrate unto Yahweh the days of his separation,
and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering: but
the days that were before shall be lost, because his separation was
defiled.

6:13 And this is the law of the Nazarite, when the days of his
separation are fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the door of the
tabernacle of the congregation:

6:14 And he shall offer his offering unto Yahweh, one he lamb of the
first year without blemish for a burnt offering, and one ewe lamb of the
first year without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without
blemish for peace offerings,

6:15 And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with
oil, and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil, and their meat
offering, and their drink offerings.

6:16 And the priest shall bring them before Yahweh, and shall offer
his sin offering, and his burnt offering:

6:17 And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto
Yahweh with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest shall offer
also his meat offering, and his drink offering.

6:18 And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door
of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair of the
head of his separation, and put it in the fire which is under the
sacrifice of the peace offerings.

6:19 And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram, and one
unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall
put them upon the hands of the Nazarite, after the hair of his
separation is shaven:

6:20 And the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before Yahweh: 
this is holy for the priest, with the wave breast and heave shoulder:
and after that the Nazarite may drink wine.

6:21 This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, and of his offering
unto Yahweh for his separation, beside that that his hand shall get:
according to the vow which he vowed, so he must do after the law of his
separation.

6:22 And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying,

6:23 Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall
bless the children of Israel, saying unto them,

6:24 Yahweh bless thee, and keep thee:

6:25 Yahweh make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee:

6:26 Yahweh lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.

6:27 And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel, and I will
bless them.",
