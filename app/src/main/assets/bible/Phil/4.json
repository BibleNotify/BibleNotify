crown, so stand fast in Yahweh, my dearly beloved.

4:2 I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same
mind in Yahweh.

4:3 And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which
laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my
fellowlabourers, whose names are in the book of life.

4:4 Rejoice in Yahweh alway: and again I say, Rejoice.

4:5 Let your moderation be known unto all men. Yahweh is at hand.

4:6 Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and
supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto Elohim.

4:7 And the peace of Elohim, which passeth all understanding, shall keep
your hearts and minds through Christ Yahushua.

4:8 Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are
honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure,
whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if
there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.

4:9 Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard,
and seen in me, do: and the Elohim of peace shall be with you.

4:10 But I rejoiced in Yahweh greatly, that now at the last your care
of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked
opportunity.

4:11 Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in
whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.

4:12 I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where
and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both
to abound and to suffer need.

4:13 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.

4:14 Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my
affliction.

4:15 Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel,
when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as
concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.

4:16 For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.

4:17 Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to
your account.

4:18 But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of
Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet
smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to Elohim.

4:19 But my Elohim shall supply all your need according to his riches in
glory by Christ Yahushua.

4:20 Now unto Elohim and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

4:21 Salute every saint in Christ Yahushua. The brethren which are with me
greet you.

4:22 All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's
household.

4:23 The grace of our master Yahushua Christ be with you all. Amen.",
