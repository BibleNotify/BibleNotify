down with her hands.

14:2 He that walketh in his uprightness feareth Yahweh: but he that is
perverse in his ways despiseth him.

14:3 In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride: but the lips of the
wise shall preserve them.

14:4 Where no oxen are, the crib is clean: but much increase is by the
strength of the ox.

14:5 A faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness will utter
lies.

14:6 A scorner seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not: but knowledge is easy
unto him that understandeth.

14:7 Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest not in
him the lips of knowledge.

14:8 The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way: but the folly
of fools is deceit.

14:9 Fools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous there is favour.

14:10 The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth not
intermeddle with his joy.

14:11 The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the tabernacle of
the upright shall flourish.

14:12 There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof
are the ways of death.

14:13 Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth
is heaviness.

14:14 The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and a
good man shall be satisfied from himself.

14:15 The simple believeth every word: but the prudent man looketh well
to his going.

14:16 A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool rageth,
and is confident.

14:17 He that is soon angry dealeth foolishly: and a man of wicked
devices is hated.

14:18 The simple inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with
knowledge.

14:19 The evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of the
righteous.

14:20 The poor is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich hath
many friends.

14:21 He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath mercy on
the poor, happy is he.

14:22 Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth shall be to
them that devise good.

14:23 In all labour there is profit: but the talk of the lips tendeth
only to penury.

14:24 The crown of the wise is their riches: but the foolishness of
fools is folly.

14:25 A true witness delivereth souls: but a deceitful witness speaketh
lies.

14:26 In the fear of Yahweh is strong confidence: and his children
shall have a place of refuge.

14:27 The fear of Yahweh is a fountain of life, to depart from the
snares of death.

14:28 In the multitude of people is the king's honour: but in the want
of people is the destruction of the prince.

14:29 He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding: but he that is
hasty of spirit exalteth folly.

14:30 A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy the rottenness of
the bones.

14:31 He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker: but he that
honoureth him hath mercy on the poor.

14:32 The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous
hath hope in his death.

14:33 Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding: but
that which is in the midst of fools is made known.

14:34 Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any
people.

14:35 The king's favour is toward a wise servant: but his wrath is
against him that causeth shame.",
