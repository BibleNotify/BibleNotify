before thee:

23:2 And put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to appetite.

23:3 Be not desirous of his dainties: for they are deceitful meat.

23:4 Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom.

23:5 Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches
certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward
heaven.

23:6 Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, neither desire
thou his dainty meats:

23:7 For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he: Eat and drink, saith he
to thee; but his heart is not with thee.

23:8 The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose thy
sweet words.

23:9 Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of
thy words.

23:10 Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the
fatherless:

23:11 For their redeemer is mighty; he shall plead their cause with
thee.

23:12 Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of
knowledge.

23:13 Withhold not correction from the child: for if thou beatest him
with the rod, he shall not die.

23:14 Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from
hell.

23:15 My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine.

23:16 Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things.

23:17 Let not thine heart envy sinners: but be thou in the fear of Yahweh all the day long.

23:18 For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be cut
off.

23:19 Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way.

23:20 Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:

23:21 For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and
drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.

23:22 Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy
mother when she is old.

23:23 Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction, and
understanding.

23:24 The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that
begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him.

23:25 Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee
shall rejoice.

23:26 My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways.

23:27 For a whore is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow pit.

23:28 She also lieth in wait as for a prey, and increaseth the
transgressors among men.

23:29 Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath
babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?

23:30 They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.

23:31 Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his
colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.

23:32 At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.

23:33 Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter
perverse things.

23:34 Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea,
or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.

23:35 They have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not sick; they
have beaten me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake? I will seek it
yet again.",
