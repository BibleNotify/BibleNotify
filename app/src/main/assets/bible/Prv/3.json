3:2 For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to
thee.

3:3 Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck;
write them upon the table of thine heart:

3:4 So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God
and man.

3:5 Trust in Yahweh with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own
understanding.

3:6 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.

3:7 Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear Yahweh, and depart from evil.

3:8 It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.

3:9 Honour Yahweh with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all
thine increase:

3:10 So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall
burst out with new wine.

3:11 My son, despise not the chastening of Yahweh; neither be weary of
his correction:

3:12 For whom Yahweh loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in
whom he delighteth.

3:13 Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth
understanding.

3:14 For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver,
and the gain thereof than fine gold.

3:15 She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst
desire are not to be compared unto her.

3:16 Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches
and honour.

3:17 Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.

3:18 She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is
every one that retaineth her.

3:19 Yahweh by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he
established the heavens.

3:20 By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down
the dew.

3:21 My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and
discretion:

3:22 So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.

3:23 Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not
stumble.

3:24 When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie
down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.

3:25 Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the
wicked, when it cometh.

3:26 For Yahweh shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from
being taken.

3:27 Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the
power of thine hand to do it.

3:28 Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I
will give; when thou hast it by thee.

3:29 Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely
by thee.

3:30 Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.

3:31 Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.

3:32 For the froward is abomination to Yahweh: but his secret is with
the righteous.

3:33 The curse of Yahweh is in the house of the wicked: but he
blesseth the habitation of the just.

3:34 Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the
lowly.

3:35 The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of
fools.",
