      "text": "144:1 Blessed be Yahweh my strength which teacheth my hands to war,
and my fingers to fight:

144:2 My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my
shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me.

144:3 Yahweh, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him! or the son
of man, that thou makest account of him!

144:4 Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passeth away.

144:5 Bow thy heavens, O Yahweh and come down: touch the mountains, and
they shall smoke.

144:6 Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine arrows,
and destroy them.

144:7 Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great
waters, from the hand of strange children;

144:8 Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand
of falsehood.

144:9 I will sing a new song unto thee, O Elohim: upon a psaltery and an
instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.

144:10 It is he that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth David
his servant from the hurtful sword.

144:11 Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose
mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of
falsehood:

144:12 That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our
daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a
palace:

144:13 That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store: that
our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets:

144:14 That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no breaking
in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our streets.

144:15 Happy is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is that
people, whose mighty one is the Yahweh.",
