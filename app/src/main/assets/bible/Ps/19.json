handywork.

19:2 Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth
knowledge.

19:3 There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.

19:4 Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to
the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,

19:5 Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth
as a strong man to run a race.

19:6 His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto
the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.

19:7 The law of Yahweh is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony
of Yahweh is sure, making wise the simple.

19:8 The statutes of Yahweh are right, rejoicing the heart: the
commandment of Yahweh is pure, enlightening the eyes.

19:9 The fear of Yahweh is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of Yahweh
 are true and righteous altogether.

19:10 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold:
sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.

19:11 Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them
there is great reward.

19:12 Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults.

19:13 Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not
have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent
from the great transgression.

19:14 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be
acceptable in thy sight, O Yahweh, my strength, and my redeemer.",
