2:2 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel
together, against Yahweh, and against his anointed, saying,

2:3 Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.

2:4 He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: Yahweh shall have them
in derision.

2:5 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore
displeasure.

2:6 Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.

2:7 I will declare the decree: Yahweh hath said unto me, Thou art my
Son; this day have I begotten thee.

2:8 Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance,
and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.

2:9 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in
pieces like a potter's vessel.

2:10 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the
earth.

2:11 Serve Yahweh with fear, and rejoice with trembling.

2:12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when
his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their
trust in him.",
