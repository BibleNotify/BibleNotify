covered.

32:2 Blessed is the man unto whom Yahweh imputeth not iniquity, and in
whose spirit there is no guile.

32:3 When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the
day long.

32:4 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned
into the drought of summer. Selah.

32:5 I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I
said, I will confess my transgressions unto Yahweh; and thou forgavest
the iniquity of my sin. Selah.

32:6 For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time
when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they
shall not come nigh unto him.

32:7 Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou
shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.

32:8 I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go:
I will guide thee with mine eye.

32:9 Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no
understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest
they come near unto thee.

32:10 Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in Yahweh,
 mercy shall compass him about.

32:11 Be glad in Yahweh, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy,
all ye that are upright in heart.",
