fighting daily oppresseth me.

56:2 Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many that fight
against me, O thou most High.

56:3 What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.

56:4 In God I will praise his word, in Elohim I have put my trust; I will
not fear what flesh can do unto me.

56:5 Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against me
for evil.

56:6 They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my
steps, when they wait for my soul.

56:7 Shall they escape by iniquity? in thine anger cast down the people,
O Elohim.

56:8 Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: are
they not in thy book?

56:9 When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back: this I
know; for Elohim is for me.

56:10 In Elohim will I praise his word: in Yahweh will I praise his word.

56:11 In Elohim have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do
unto me.

56:12 Thy vows are upon me, O Elohim: I will render praises unto thee.

56:13 For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou deliver
my feet from falling, that I may walk before Elohim in the light of the
living?",
