present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto Elohim, which
is your reasonable service.

12:2 And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the
renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and
acceptable, and perfect, will of Elohim.

12:3 For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is
among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think;
but to think soberly, according as Elohim hath dealt to every man the
measure of faith.

12:4 For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not
the same office:

12:5 So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members
one of another.

12:6 Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to
us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of
faith;

12:7 Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth,
on teaching;

12:8 Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it
with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy,
with cheerfulness.

12:9 Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave
to that which is good.

12:10 Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in
honour preferring one another;

12:11 Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Yahweh;

12:12 Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in
prayer;

12:13 Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.

12:14 Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.

12:15 Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.

12:16 Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but
condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.

12:17 Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the
sight of all men.

12:18 If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with
all men.

12:19 Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto
wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the
Yahweh.

12:20 Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him
drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.

12:21 Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.",
