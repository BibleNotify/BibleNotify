abound?

6:2 Elohim forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer
therein?

6:3 Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Yahushua Christ
were baptized into his death?

6:4 Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as
Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so
we also should walk in newness of life.

6:5 For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death,
we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:

6:6 Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body
of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.

6:7 For he that is dead is freed from sin.

6:8 Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live
with him:

6:9 Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death
hath no more dominion over him.

6:10 For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth,
he liveth unto Elohim.

6:11 Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but
alive unto Elohim through Yahushua Christ our master.

6:12 Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should
obey it in the lusts thereof.

6:13 Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness
unto sin: but yield yourselves unto Elohim, as those that are alive from
the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto Elohim.

6:14 For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the
law, but under grace.

6:15 What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but
under grace? Elohim forbid.

6:16 Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his
servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of
obedience unto righteousness?

6:17 But Elohim be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have
obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.

6:18 Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of
righteousness.

6:19 I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your
flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and
to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to
righteousness unto holiness.

6:20 For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from
righteousness.

6:21 What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed?
for the end of those things is death.

6:22 But now being made free from sin, and become servants to Elohim, ye
have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.

6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of Elohim is eternal life
through Yahushua Christ our master.",
