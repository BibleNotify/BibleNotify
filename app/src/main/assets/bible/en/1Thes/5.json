And be at peace among yourselves.</p><p><sup>14</sup> Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.</p><p><sup>15</sup> See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men.</p><p><sup>16</sup> Rejoice evermore.</p><p><sup>17</sup> Pray without ceasing.</p><p><sup>18</sup> In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of Elohim in Messiah Yahushua concerning you.</p><p><sup>19</sup> Quench not the Spirit.</p><p><sup>20</sup> Despise not prophesyings.</p><p><sup>21</sup> Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.</p><p><sup>22</sup> Abstain from all appearance of evil.</p><p><sup>23</sup> And the very Elohim of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray Elohim your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our master Yahushua Messiah.</p><p><sup>24</sup> Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.</p><p><sup>25</sup> Brethren, pray for us.</p><p><sup>26</sup> Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.</p><p><sup>27</sup> I charge you by Yahweh that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.</p><p><sup>28</sup> The grace of our master Yahushua Messiah be with you.
