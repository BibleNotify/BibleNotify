And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation.</p><p><sup>15</sup> And Yahweh appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud: and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle.</p><p><sup>16</sup> And Yahweh said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land, whither they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.</p><p><sup>17</sup> Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because our Elohim is not among us?</p><p><sup>18</sup> And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other Mighty ones.</p><p><sup>19</sup> Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.</p><p><sup>20</sup> For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.</p><p><sup>21</sup> And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I sware.</p><p><sup>22</sup> Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.</p><p><sup>23</sup> And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee.</p><p><sup>24</sup> And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,</p><p><sup>25</sup> That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, saying,</p><p><sup>26</sup> Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of Yahweh your Elohim that it may be there for a witness against thee.</p><p><sup>27</sup> For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against Yahweh  and how much more after my death?</p><p><sup>28</sup> Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them.</p><p><sup>29</sup> For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the sight of  Yahweh</p><p> 31:30 And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song, until they were ended.</p>",       "chapter": "Deuteronomy 31"     }  ] }
