I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.</p><p><sup>20</sup> The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen.</p><p><sup>21</sup> This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.</p><p><sup>22</sup> But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel.</p><p><sup>23</sup> Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incense.</p><p><sup>24</sup> Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.</p><p><sup>25</sup> I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.</p><p><sup>26</sup> Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that thou mayest be justified.</p><p><sup>27</sup> Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me.</p><p><sup>28</sup> Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.</p>",       "chapter": "Isaiah 43"     }  ] }
