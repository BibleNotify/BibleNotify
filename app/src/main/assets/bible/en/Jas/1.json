For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.</p><p><sup>7</sup> For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of Yahweh.</p><p><sup>8</sup> A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.</p><p><sup>9</sup> Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:</p><p><sup>10</sup> But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.</p><p><sup>11</sup> For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</p><p><sup>12</sup> Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which Yahweh hath promised to them that love him.</p><p><sup>13</sup> Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of Elohim: for Elohim cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:</p><p><sup>14</sup> But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.</p><p><sup>15</sup> Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.</p><p><sup>16</sup> Do not err, my beloved brethren.</p><p><sup>17</sup> Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.</p><p><sup>18</sup> Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.</p><p><sup>19</sup> Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:</p><p><sup>20</sup> For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of Elohim.</p><p><sup>21</sup> Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</p><p><sup>22</sup> But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</p><p><sup>23</sup> For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:</p><p><sup>24</sup> For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.</p><p><sup>25</sup> But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.</p><p><sup>26</sup> If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.</p><p><sup>27</sup> Pure religion and undefiled before messiah and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.</p>",       "chapter": "James 1"     }  ] }
