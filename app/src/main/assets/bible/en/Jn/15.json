As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.</p><p><sup>5</sup> I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.</p><p><sup>6</sup> If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.</p><p><sup>7</sup> If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.</p><p><sup>8</sup> Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.</p><p><sup>9</sup> As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.</p><p><sup>10</sup> If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.</p><p><sup>11</sup> These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.</p><p><sup>12</sup> This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.</p><p><sup>13</sup> Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</p><p><sup>14</sup> Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.</p><p><sup>15</sup> Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.</p><p><sup>16</sup> Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.</p><p><sup>17</sup> These things I command you, that ye love one another.</p><p><sup>18</sup> If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.</p><p><sup>19</sup> If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</p><p><sup>20</sup> Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.</p><p><sup>21</sup> But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.</p><p><sup>22</sup> If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin.</p><p><sup>23</sup> He that hateth me hateth my Father also.</p><p><sup>24</sup> If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.</p><p><sup>25</sup> But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.</p><p><sup>26</sup> But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:</p><p><sup>27</sup> And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.</p>",       "chapter": "John 15"     }  ] }
