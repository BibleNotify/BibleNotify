Yahweh is at hand.</p><p><sup>6</sup> Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto Elohim.</p><p><sup>7</sup> And the peace of Elohim, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Messiah Yahushua.</p><p><sup>8</sup> Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.</p><p><sup>9</sup> Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the Elohim of peace shall be with you.</p><p><sup>10</sup> But I rejoiced in Yahweh greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.</p><p><sup>11</sup> Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.</p><p><sup>12</sup> I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.</p><p><sup>13</sup> I can do all things through Messiah which strengtheneth me.</p><p><sup>14</sup> Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.</p><p><sup>15</sup> Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.</p><p><sup>16</sup> For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.</p><p><sup>17</sup> Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.</p><p><sup>18</sup> But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to Elohim.</p><p><sup>19</sup> But my Elohim shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Messiah Yahushua.</p><p><sup>20</sup> Now unto Elohim and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p><p><sup>21</sup> Salute every saint in Messiah Yahushua. The brethren which are with me greet you.</p><p><sup>22</sup> All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household.</p><p><sup>23</sup> The grace of our master Yahushua Messiah be with you all. Amen.</p>",       "chapter": "Philippians 4"     } ] }
