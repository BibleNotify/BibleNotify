Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.</p><p><sup>10</sup> Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;</p><p><sup>11</sup> Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Yahweh;</p><p><sup>12</sup> Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;</p><p><sup>13</sup> Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.</p><p><sup>14</sup> Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.</p><p><sup>15</sup> Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.</p><p><sup>16</sup> Be of the same mind one toward another.

Provide things honest in the sight of all men.</p><p><sup>18</sup> If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.</p><p><sup>19</sup> Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Yahweh.</p><p><sup>20</sup> Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.</p><p><sup>21</sup> Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</p>",       "chapter": "Romans 12"     }  ] }
