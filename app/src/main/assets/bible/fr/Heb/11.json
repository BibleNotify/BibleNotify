for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:</p><p><sup>33</sup> Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions.</p><p><sup>34</sup> Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.</p><p><sup>35</sup> Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:</p><p><sup>36</sup> And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:</p><p><sup>37</sup> They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;</p><p><sup>38</sup> (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.</p><p><sup>39</sup> And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:</p><p><sup>40</sup> Yahweh having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.</p>",       "chapter": "Hebrews 11"     }  ] }
